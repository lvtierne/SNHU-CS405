# Reflective Journal

## Topics Covered:

### 1. Adoption of Secure Coding Standards:
   - Embraced industry-standard secure coding practices from reputable sources like CERT Division and OWASP.
   - Implemented recommendations from "Secure Coding in C and C++" by Robert C. Seacord.

### 2. Evaluation and Assessment of Risk:
   - Utilized NIST SP 800-30 and ISO/IEC 27005:2018 for comprehensive risk assessments.
   - Balanced the costs and benefits of risk mitigation strategies to ensure optimal resource allocation.

### 3. Zero Trust:
   - Adopted a Zero Trust architecture, moving away from perimeter-based security to continuous verification and least privilege access.
   - Referenced resources such as Forrester Research and Palo Alto Networks for guidance on implementing Zero Trust principles.

### 4. Implementation and Recommendations of Security Policies:
   - Developed robust security policies based on guidelines provided by organizations like NCSC and SANS Institute.
   - Ensured alignment with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.

## Critical Reflection:
   - Recognized the importance of integrating security into the software development lifecycle rather than treating it as an afterthought.
   - Emphasized the significance of continuous learning and adaptation to evolving security threats.
   - Acknowledged the role of secure coding practices, risk assessment, Zero Trust, and security policy implementation in enhancing overall cybersecurity posture.
